1. Delete any previous adobe stuff from your system using revo pro uninstaller trial on their website and scan all windows account leftover otherwise might not work
2. IDK how to combine them into 1 or make it pretty so if u can do it you can and maybe share here otherwise the ccstopper script is to stop adobe process etc and the other one is to add 
   the host to block.


>Stop-Process -Name "Adobe Desktop Service" -force
